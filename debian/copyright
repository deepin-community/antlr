 SOFTWARE RIGHTS

 ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
 Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com
 .
 We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
 public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
 they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
 code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
 ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.
 .
 We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
 we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
 ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
 incorporate any source code into one of your programs
 (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
 you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
 research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
 developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
 you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
 headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
 guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
 system and expect to make other tools available as they are
 completed.

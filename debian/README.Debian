antlr for Debian
----------------------

* Version 4 of this package, now compiles the java files (previously I
used precompiled classes). Because of this antlr.jar, antlr.debug.jar
and antlrall.jar are all copies of the same file (I couldn't determine
exactly which files belong where).

* This package installs antlr.jar, antlr.debug.jar and antlrall.jar in
/usr/share/java
